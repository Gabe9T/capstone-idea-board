### by Gabriel Tucker 

This Appication would be used by skiers and also be used for other activities in the area 

#### The purpose of this progeam would be to 

* inform people of weather conditions 
* inprove the buddy system 
* Track friends and family on the mountain 


#### The end goal of this program would be 

* Informing people of weather conditions before they go out. 
* Having emergency contact info of the certain area your in 
* having an effective way of tracking whoever your skiing with or really anyone you want to track you while skiing

A roadblock I see coming is finding a way to track your pair when their is no cell service. depnding where your at on the mountain you dont have any. have not thought of a way around this yet. 
First thing i would do when making this app is making a nice way to see the day/week(s) weather conditions, i would like to find a way to intergrate a live cam. Most resorts have a couple, so depending on what mountain you have selected you get that certain cam. it would give a nice visualization of what it looks like up there.
